## Option 3: Screenshot Tools (Paid but Easy)

## Quick Method (What I Recommend):

1. **Use Xcode Simulator** (free, perfect quality)
   ```bash
   # Start your app
   npm start
   
   # Press 'i' for iOS simulator
   # In simulator: Device → iPhone 15 Pro Max
   # Navigate to each screen
   # Press Cmd+S to save screenshot
   
   # Repeat for iPhone 14 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus
   ```

2. **Or use your iPhone + online resizer**
   - Take 5 screenshots on your phone
   - Upload to https://www.appscreenshots.com/resize
   - Download all required sizes

## Pro Tips:

- **Clean up screenshots**: Remove status bar clutter
- **Show real content**: Don't use placeholder text
- **Highlight features**: Show the app actually being used
- **Add captions**: Optional but helpful (use Canva free)
- **Consistent theme**: Use same time/battery level across screenshots

## Required Sizes:

- **6.7" Display (iPhone 15 Pro Max)**: 1290 x 2796 pixels
- **6.5" Display (iPhone 14 Plus)**: 1284 x 2778 pixels  
- **5.5" Display (iPhone 8 Plus)**: 1242 x 2208 pixels

You only need ONE set of screenshots for the largest size (6.7"), and Apple will scale them down. But providing all sizes looks more professional.

## Screenshot Checklist:

- [ ] Home screen showing mood tracker
- [ ] Tools screen with technique examples
- [ ] AI Support showing helpful conversation
- [ ] Crisis resources prominently displayed
- [ ] Progress screen with charts
- [ ] All screenshots are correct dimensions
