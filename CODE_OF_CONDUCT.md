## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:
- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project communications (email, chat, etc.)
- Public spaces when representing the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainer. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Special Considerations

Given that Anchor serves people with PTSD and trauma:

- **Be Trauma-Informed**: Use sensitive language and avoid triggering content
- **Prioritize Safety**: User safety is paramount in all decisions
- **Respect Privacy**: Never discuss or share user data
- **Professional Boundaries**: Maintain appropriate boundaries in discussions
- **Crisis Awareness**: Be mindful that users may be in crisis
